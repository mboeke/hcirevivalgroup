# Example Data for Change Analysis and Bug Detection for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)

The following GitHub repository contains several methods to extract commit changes and issues from any GitHub repository. These methods only require the URL of the corresponding GitHub repository(ies).

## Goal of Repository
We created this repository as part of a university project. The project's aim was to analyse a set of GitHub repositories of CPS projects to classify a set of commits based on their changes. This set of classified changes can then be used to train ML based bug prediction algorithms for the correct interpretation of commit changes. The result of classified commit changes provides a high and low level change classification as well as the significance of such a change.

## Motivation of Project
As mentioned above for each analysed commit change, we provided a significance level. Understanding the significance of a certain commit change is particular important for CPS projects, because of the various effects such a code change may impose on the CPS.
