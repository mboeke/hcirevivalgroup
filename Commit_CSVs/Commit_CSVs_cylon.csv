I apologize for this commit message but cylon-specs + this was just too perfect.

Anyways, have gotten Cylon robot specs working now. For some reason by the time
the spec runner gets around to running cylon.spec, inside cylon.js Robot has
been redefined to an empty object '{}'.

This resulted in a ""TypeError: object is not a function on constructor"" error.

So to solve this I moved the require() for 'robot' inside the Cylon.robot()
method. This shouldn't reload code thanks to Node's require cache, but will
properly assign Robot when instantiating a new one.","['cylon.js,cylon.coffee,cylon.spec.js,cylon.spec.coffee']"

This commit also updates most of the other source files in Cylon, requiring the
Utils module rather than assuming the methods are in the global namespace.

A similar batch of commits will need to be made for all other Cylon modules to
make sure they don't explode when they can't find #subclass or something like
that.

Simple extraction out of Connection/Device initialization code inside
Robot.

This yields an interesting boon, however - this is now a valid Cylon
program:

      .robot()
      .connection({ name: 'loopback', adaptor: 'loopback' })
      .device({ name: 'ping', driver: 'ping' })

Andrew Stewart,2015-07-13,"Simplify logger

This commit adds a simplified logging system, with two primary methods:

- `Logger#log(String) :: void` (for normal logging)
- `Logger#debug(String) :: void` (for debug logging)

This helps dramatically simplify logging infrastructure, as well as
enabling simpler toggling of log modes.

The configuration values for the Logger have also been updated:

- `logger :: Function` - function to log output to (both normal + debug)
- `silent :: Boolean` - whether to log default normal messages or not (`--silent` flag)
- `debug  :: Boolean` - whether or not to log debug output (`--debug` flag)

Additionally, the following CLI flags are supported re: logging:

- `--silent` disables normal logging (will override all other settings)
- `--debug` enables debug logging

Deprecation notices have been added for old log methods, with first-run
messages to this effect.

This change should have negligible impact on end-users, with minor
inconvenience for library developers, as they need to switch their
logging function calls over.

Logging configuration is still possible via both
`Cylon.Config.update(Object)`, and directly calling
`Cylon.Logger.setup(Object)`.","['api.js,config.js,logger.js,basic_logger.js,null_logger.js,mcp.js,robot.js,validator.js,logger.spec.js,basic_logger.spec.js,robot.spec.js']"
