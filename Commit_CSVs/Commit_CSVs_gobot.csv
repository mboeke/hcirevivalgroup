Marc-Antoine Ruel,2017-03-25,"Significantly speed up travis and make runs

- Inline ci/travis.sh into .travis.yml
- Use two go test steps instead of once for speed up
- Drop the whitelist and use all the packages as listed from $(go list ./...).
  This removes the need to do bookeeping in both .travis.yml and Makefile during
  refactoring.
- Trimmed the Makefile significantly. Removed ""go test -i"" as while this is
  extremely helpful when cross compiling, it doesn't help when compiling for the
  host.
- Added deps as a phony target, made this step faster. I'm not sure of the
  usefulness of this step though and would recommend to remove it.
- 'make examples' is currently broken so I didn't add it to .travis.yml.

I experimented a bit on travis with go test on another similar project, timings
for the go test step only:
- Using both -race and -coverprofile with the loop over $(go list ./...) took
  190s
- Using -coverprofile alone with the loop over $(go list ./...) took 10~11s
- Using -race ./... took 5s

It means that using one after the other takes 16~17s while running with both
flags takes 190s. A 91% speedup. Add my previous commit that cut off the test
runtime by half, the total speed will be appreciable.","['.travis.yml,Makefile,travis.sh']"
