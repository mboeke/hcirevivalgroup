The solution is for `note()` to call `frequency()` instead, which will do the appropriate conversion.Since it took me a while to understand the relationships between `tone`, `frequency` and `note` I've added some documentation to those methods to clear things up for the next person.  I've also made some unit tests more aggressive about checking that values are converted appropriately as they're passed around, and commented note-frequency-duty equivalencies to help the test read nicer.* Fix lint error* Address review feedback- Test that `note()` is case-insensitive- Better description of default octave- One-line Piezo.prototype.note- s/frequncy/frequency- Note tests demonstrate the difference between note letter and octave number better","['piezo.js,piezo.js']"

When two animation segments were enqueued on the same pass through the even loop we were starting both segments because the isRunning state was not being set until nextTick.This should fix all that. I've updated some of the tests which I believe were written in a non-intuitive manner because of this bug. Instead of really understanding the problem I had just written the tests in a way that made them pass. There's probably a name for this sort of behavior. If not, we should invent a name.","['animation.js,animation.js,animation.js']"
