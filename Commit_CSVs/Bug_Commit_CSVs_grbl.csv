Github just erased my list of improvements and changes due to aconflict and forcing me to resolve it. Hope this goes through.- Major stepper algorithm change. Trashed the old v0.9 edgebranch-style stepper algorithm. It‚Äôs fine, but it was susceptible toaliasing noise when moving very slow or very fast. It also had a bit ofCPU overhead. It was written to solve a standing issue with v0.8master, where it couldn‚Äôt generate a smooth acceleration abocve10-15kHz. But, with new step segment buffer in v0.9c, it inadvertentlyfixed the acceleration problem with v0.8 stepper algorithm. So, whatdoes it mean for you? Smoother stepper pulses and likely higher stepfrequencies.- Stepper algorithm now uses Timer1 and Timer2, instead of Timer0 andTimer2. Timers 0 and 2 can be swapped if there is an issue.- With the old v0.8 stepper algorithm, the STEP_DELAY_PULSEconfiguration option is also back.- NEW! Hard limit software debouncing. Grbl now employs the AVR‚Äôswatchdog timer as a way to monitor the hard limit pins and checkingtheir states after a delay. This is a simple software debouncingtechnique and may help alleviate some of the false trigger some usershave been complaining about. BUT, this won‚Äôt fix electric noise issues!- Fixed an issue with the new homing cycle routine where it wasn‚Äôthonoring the acceleration and axis speed limits depending on the homingcycle mask. Now does. Also, updated the homing direction mask code tobe a little cleaner.- Moved the main part of the homing cycle control and execution tomotion_control.c, where it fits better.- Removed the STATE_INIT system state as it was redundant.

12f48a008a2432df99771ff3223ba3f98578acc1,chamnit,2016-09-21,"Grbl v1.0e huge beta release. Overrides and new reporting.- Feature: Realtime feed, rapid, and spindle speed overrides. Thesealter the running machine state within tens of milliseconds!    - Feed override: 100%, +/-10%, +/-1% commands with values 1-200% ofprogrammed feed    - Rapid override: 100%, 50%, 25% rapid rate commands    - Spindle speed override: 100%, +/-10%, +/-1% commands with values50-200% of programmed speed    - Override values have configurable limits and increments inconfig.h.- Feature: Realtime toggle overrides for spindle stop, flood coolant,and optionally mist coolant    - Spindle stop: Enables and disables spindle during a feed hold.Automatically restores last spindles state.    - Flood and mist coolant: Immediately toggles coolant state untilnext toggle or g-code coolant command.- Feature: Jogging mode! Incremental and absolute modes supported.    - Grbl accepts jogging-specific commands like $J=X100F50. An axisword and feed rate are required. G20/21 and G90/G91 commands areaccepted.    - Jog motions can be canceled at any time by a feed hold `!`command. The buffer is automatically flushed. (No resetting required).    - Jog motions do not alter the g-code parser state so GUIs don‚Äôthave to track what they changed and correct it.- Feature: Laser mode setting. Allows Grbl to execute continuousmotions with spindle speed and state changes.- Feature: Significantly improved status reports. Overhauled to cram inmore meaningful data and still make it smaller on average.    - All available data is now sent by default, but does not appear ifit doesn‚Äôt change or is not active.    - Machine position(MPos) or work position(WPos) is reported but notboth at the same time. Instead, the work coordinate offsets (WCO)aresent intermittently whenever it changes or refreshes after 10-30 statusreports. Position vectors are easily computed by WPos  = MPos - WCO.    - All data has changed in some way. Details of changes are in themarkdown documents and wiki.- Feature: 16 new realtime commands to control overrides. All inextended-ASCII character space.    - While they are not easily typeable and requires a GUI, they can‚Äôtbe accidentally triggered by some latent character in the g-codeprogram and have tons of room for expansion.- Feature: New substates for HOLD and SAFETY DOOR. A `:x` is appendedto the state, where `x` is an integer and indicates a substate.    - For example, each integer of a door state describes in what phasethe machine is in during parking. Substates are detailed in thedocumentation.- Feature: With the alarm codes, homing and probe alarms have beenexpanded with more codes to provide more exact feedback on what causedthe alarm.- Feature: New hard limit check upon power-up or reset. If detected, afeedback message to check the limit switches sent immediately after thewelcome message.    - May be disabled in config.h.- OEM feature: Enable/disable `$RST=` individual commands based ondesired behavior in config.h.- OEM feature: Configurable EEPROM wipe to prevent certain data frombeing deleted during firmware upgrade to a new settings version or`RST=*` command.- OEM feature: Enable/disable the `$I=` build info write string withexternal EEPROM write example sketch.    - This prevents a user from altering the build info string inEEPROM. This requires the vendor to write the string to EEPROM viaexternal means. An Arduino example sketch is provided to accomplishthis. This would be useful for contain product data that isretrievable.- Tweak: All feedback has been drastically trimmed to free up flashspace for the v1.0 release.    - The `$` help message is just one string, listing availablecommands.    - The `$$` settings printout no longer includes descriptions. Onlythe setting values. (Sorry it‚Äôs this or remove overrides!)    - Grbl `error:` and `ALARM:` responses now only contain codes. Nodescriptions. All codes are explained in documentation.    - Grbl‚Äôs old feedback style may be restored via a config.h, butkeep in mind that it will likely not fit into the Arduino‚Äôs flash space.- Tweak: Grbl now forces a buffer sync or stop motion whenever a g-codecommand needs to update and write a value to EEPROM or changes the workcoordinate offset.    - This addresses two old issues in all prior Grbl versions. First,an EEPROM write requires interrupts to be disabled, including stepperand serial comm. Steps can be lost and data can be corrupted. Second,the work position may not be correlated to the actual machine position,since machine position is derived from the actual current executionstate, while work position is based on the g-code parser offset state.They are usually not in sync and the parser state is several motionsbehind. This forced sync ensures work and machine positions are alwayscorrect.    - This behavior can be disabled through a config.h option, but it‚Äôsnot recommended to do so.- Tweak: To make status reports standardized, users can no longerchange what is reported via status report mask, except for onlytoggling machine or work positions.    - All other data fields are included in the report and can only bedisabled through the config.h file. It‚Äôs not recommended to alter this,because GUIs will be expecting this data to be present and may not becompatible.- Tweak: Homing cycle and parking motion no longer report a negativeline number in a status report. These will now not report a line numberat all.- Tweak: New `[Restoring spindle]` message when restoring from aspindle stop override. Provides feedback what Grbl is doing while thespindle is powering up and a 4.0 second delay is enforced.- Tweak: Override values are reset to 100% upon M2/30. This behaviorcan be disabled in config.h- Tweak: The planner buffer size has been reduced from 18 to 16 to freeup RAM for tracking and controlling overrides.- Tweak: TX buffer size has been increased from 64 to 90 bytes toimprove status reporting and overall performance.- Tweak: Removed the MOTION CANCEL state. It was redundant and didn‚Äôtaffect Grbl‚Äôs overall operation by doing so.- Tweak: Grbl‚Äôs serial buffer increased by +1 internally, such that 128bytes means 128, not 127 due to the ring buffer implementation. Longoverdue.- Tweak: Altered sys.alarm variable to be set by alarm codes, ratherthan bit flags. Simplified how it worked overall.- Tweak: Planner buffer and serial RX buffer usage has been combined inthe status reports.- Tweak: Pin state reporting has been refactored to report only thepins ‚Äútriggered‚Äù and nothing when not ‚Äútriggered‚Äù.- Tweak: Current machine rate or speed is now included in every report.- Tweak: The work coordinate offset (WCO) and override states only needto be refreshed intermittently or reported when they change. Therefresh rates may be altered for each in the config.h file withdifferent idle and busy rates to lessen Grbl‚Äôs load during a job.- Tweak: For temporary compatibility to existing GUIs until they areupdated, an option to revert back to the old style status reports isavailable in config.h, but not recommended for long term use.- Tweak: Removed old limit pin state reporting option from config.h inlieu of new status report that includes them.- Tweak: Updated the defaults.h file to include laser mode, alteredstatus report mask, and fix an issue with a missing invert probe pindefault.- Refactor: Changed how planner line data is generated and passed tothe planner and onto the step generator. By making it a structvariable, this saved significant flash space.- Refactor: Major re-factoring of the planner to incorporate overridevalues and allow for re-calculations fast enough to immediately takeeffect during operation. No small feat.- Refactor: Re-factored the step segment generator for re-computing newoverride states.- Refactor: Re-factored spindle_control.c to accommodate the spindlespeed overrides and laser mode.- Refactor: Re-factored parts of the codebase for a new jogging mode.Still under development though and slated to be part of the officialv1.0 release. Hang tight.- Refactor: Created functions for computing a unit vector and valuelimiting based on axis maximums to free up more flash.- Refactor: The spindle PWM is now set directly inside of the stepperISR as it loads new step segments.- Refactor: Moved machine travel checks out of soft limits functioninto its own since jogging uses this too.- Refactor: Removed coolant_stop() and combined withcoolant_set_state().- Refactor: The serial RX ISR forks off extended ASCII values toquickly assess the new override realtime commands.- Refactor: Altered some names of the step control flags.- Refactor: Improved efficiency of the serial RX get buffer countfunction.- Refactor: Saved significant flash by removing and combining printfunctions. Namely the uint8 base10 and base2 functions.- Refactor: Moved the probe state check in the main stepper ISR toimprove its efficiency.- Refactor: Single character printPgmStrings() went converted to directserial_write() commands to save significant flash space.- Documentation: Detailed Markdown documents on error codes, alarmcodes, messages, new real-time commands, new status reports, and howjogging works. More to come later and will be posted on the Wiki aswell.- Documentation: CSV files for quick importing of Grbl error and alarmcodes.- Bug Fix: Applied v0.9 master fixes to CoreXY homing.- Bug Fix: The print float function would cause Grbl to crash if avalue was 1e6 or greater. Increased the buffer by 3 bytes to helpprevent this in the future.- Bug Fix: Build info and startup string EEPROM restoring was notwriting the checksum value.- Bug Fix: Corrected an issue with safety door restoring the properspindle and coolant state. It worked before, but breaks with laser modethat can continually change spindle state per planner block.- Bug Fix: Move system position and probe position arrays out of thesystem_t struct.

Spindle enable pin option.[ver] v1.1f update due to tweaks to interface from new parking overridecontrol.[new] Parking motion override control via new `M56 P0` and `M56 P1`command, which disables and enables the parking motion, respectively.Requires ENABLE_PARKING_OVERRIDE_CONTROL and PARKING_ENABLE enabled inconfig.h. Primarily for OEMs.[new] `M56` appears in the $G report when enabled.[new] Five new build info identification letters. Some were missing anda couple are new. Updated the CSV and documentation to reflect thesenew items.[new] Spindle enable pin configuration option to alter its behaviorbased on how certain lasers work. By default, Grbl treats the enablepin separately and leaves it on when S is 0. The new option turns theenable pin on and off with S>0 and S=0. This only is in effect when auser enables the USE_SPINDLE_DIR_AS_ENABLE_PIN option.[fix] M4 is now allowed to work when USE_SPINDLE_DIR_AS_ENABLE_PIN isenabled. Previously this was blocked and was problematic for laserfolks using M4.[fix] Properly declared system variables as extern. Not sure how thatwent unnoticed or why it worked up until now but it has.[fix] EXTREMELY RARE. When AMASS is intentionally disabled and sent amotion command that is _one step_ in length, Grbl would not actuate thestep due to numerical round-off. Applied a fix to prevent the round-offissue.[fix] Added a compile-time check for AMASS settings to make sure thatthe numerical round-off issue doesn‚Äôt effect it. This would only happenif someone set AMASS max levels to zero. It does not effect AMASS withits current defaults.[fix] Wrapped the mc_parking_motion() function in an ifdef for portingpurposes.[fix] Fixed an issue when in inverse time mode and G0‚Äôs would require aF word. This was not correct.[fix] Added a note in the defaults.h file that MAX_TRAVEL values mustbe positive. Some users were setting this negative and it was causingissues.","['build_option_codes_en_US.csv,commit_log_v1.1.txt,change_summary.md,commands.md,interface.md,laser_mode.md,config.h,defaults.h,gcode.c,gcode.h,grbl.h,main.c,motion_control.c,motion_control.h,protocol.c,report.c,spindle_control.c,stepper.c,system.h']"
